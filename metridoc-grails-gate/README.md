metridoc-grails-gate Documentation
==================================

Purpose:
--------
Search, view, and download the number of library entries by category during a specified time interval.

Installation:
-------------
In order to use this plugin, 6 extra MySQL tables are needed in the database:
1. metridoc_gate_affiliation
2. metridoc_gate_center
3. metridoc_gate_department
4. metridoc_gate_door
5. metridoc_gate_USC
6. metridoc_gate_entry_record


To create and populate these tables, run the queries in the 6 sql files with their corresponding table names under the directory **sql_table_init**.

You can use the following commands on the command line to create these tables and import basic data into your database in the **sql_table_init directory**, replace **"root"** with your own username:

```bash
mysql -u root -p metridoc < metridoc_gate_USC.sql
mysql -u root -p metridoc < metridoc_gate_affiliation.sql
mysql -u root -p metridoc < metridoc_gate_center.sql
mysql -u root -p metridoc < metridoc_gate_department.sql
mysql -u root -p metridoc < metridoc_gate_door.sql
mysql -u root -p metridoc < metridoc_gate_entry_record.sql
```

Please make sure to import **metridoc_gate_entry_record** last since it depends on the other 5 tables.

Then, Metridoc-app also needs to know the existence of a new plugin. Therefore, under the line 
```groovy
grails.plugin.location."metridoc-rid" = "../metridoc-grails/metridoc-grails-rid"
```
in the file metridoc-app/grails-app/config/BuildConfig.groovy, add the following line:
```groovy
grails.plugin.location."metridoc-gate" = "../metridoc-grails/metridoc-grails-gate"
```
In the same file, under the line:
```groovy
compile (":metridoc-funds:${metridocVersion}")
```
add the following line:
```groovy
compile (":metridoc-gate:${metridocVersion}")
```
Finally, in the same file, under the line:
```groovy
compile(":metridoc-funds:${getVersion('metridoc-bd')}")
```
add the following line:
```groovy
compile(":metridoc-gate:${getVersion('metridoc-gate')}")
```

Usage:
------
/metridoc-reports/gateTransaction/index:
This is the landing page of the application, which shows a bunch of filters when searching for library entry records. Both start time and end time are in military time (24hr) and are default to 00:00 (midnight) if nothing is entered. All categories default options are **All ____**. Users can select one or more options for each category. When users are satisfied with the filter settings, they can click search to query the database for result.

/metridoc-reports/gateTransaction/query?(filters):
This page shows the search result according to the filters specified by users. There are 3 tables on this page: 
1. Entry by different affiliations. 
2. Entry by different centers. 
3. Entry by different USCs. 


Entry by departments is omitted for now since there are over 600 departments in the database. 
When a link at the top of the page is clicked, the page will jump to its corresponding result table. For example, clicking **Center Summary** will jump to the beginning of the result table by different centers. Clicking **back to top** link will take the user back to the top of the page.
When the **Download Data** button is clicked, the application will convert the 3 tables into 3 sheets and put them in 1 csv file and start the download process of the csv file for the user.
When the **Back** button is clicked, the application will take the user back to the search page.
